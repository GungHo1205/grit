# Research Question and Overview
We look into the practices of beginner learners who have just started their formal training in computer programming. We refer to these learners as Novice Programmers. Initially, these students can be found attending an introductory programming course in a university where they learn the intricacies of syntax, computational thinking with logic formulation moving towards complex discrete data structures. In certain cases their formal novice training proceed to include Object-oriented programming and software design patterns. 

In their experiences towards becoming a professional software developer, novice programmers are introduced to a disparate set of activities and assessment tasks: some are done individually, done in pairs and some in teams. Since novice programmers will ultimately move towards becoming software engineers and developers who participate in the different stages of the software development life cycles, we intend to investigate if specific skillsets and mindsets can be introduced to novice programmers towards an early adoption of DevOps. 

DevOps is an industry-based practice that is expected from software engineers and other personnel who work towards building and deploying a software product. <to be continued>
