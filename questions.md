## Overview and Objectives

The questionnaire was sent out using an online Google Form. The questions were composed of a mix of Likert-style and open-ended questions that aims to (1) perform a diagnostic, measuring the initial knowledge of novice programmers regarding DevOps, (2) assess their openness towards learning DevOps and (3) record their insights on learning about DevOps. Both quantitative and qualitative answers will be processed later on to derive guidelines and insights that will be used to design an initial software prototype and its features. We wanted to investigate how open novice programmers are to the practice of DevOps and on how much they do and they do not know about it. For this, we looked into their answers in the survey and did a comparative analysis of their responses from the questions. 

## Question Format

Here are the list of questions used in the survey of the research. The questions were classified into four (4) parts namely, **(1)** _Demographic_, **(2)** _Closed-Ended_, **(3)** _Likert-Style_, and **(4)** _Open-Ended_. Afterwhich, each parts were further classified into subcategories. 

### Demographic Questions

**Participant Demographics**

    1. How old are you? (Age)
    2. Are youâ€¦ (Sex)
    3. From what city did you come from?
    4. From what country did you come from?

### Closed-Ended Questions

**Participant Demographics**

    1. Did you have any programming training during your Junior High School Years (Grades 7 to 10?) 
    examples: HTML, CSS, JS, Visual Basic, Visual Studio? Etc
    2. Did you have any programming training during your Senior High School Years (Grades 11 to 12?) 
    examples: HTML, CSS, JS, Visual Basic, Visual Studio? Python? etc.

    16. DevOps is a term that involves working in teams.
    17. DevOps works for programmer pairs as well.
    18. It is easy for me to understand (trace/debug) codes written by another programmer.

    camelcase, indentations, etc.)
    1.  I like it when people can see and inspect my code.
    2.  When working on a big programming project, 
    3.  I believe it is helpful to work on my code with small progresses and changes.
    4.  I think DevOps will be helpful in testing/debugging my code
    5.  I think DevOps tools can help determine specific updates to the project (commit messages).

    4.  I think DevOps tools will make projects more efficient.
    5.  I think DevOps tools can help pair teams manage and automate their file versions.
