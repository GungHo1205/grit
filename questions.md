## Research Questions

Here are the list of questions used in the survey of the research. The questions were classified into four (4) parts namely, **(1)** _Demographic_, **(2)** _Closed-Ended_, **(3)** _Likert-Style_, and **(4)** _Open-Ended_. Afterwhich, each parts were further classified into subcategories.
