## The Research

- The first phase of the research involves a formative study that investigates Filipino novice programmers: if they have background knowledge on Devops, have been using DevOps tools even if they are not familiar with them being DevOps tools, and how open they are to learning DevOps learning. We also intend to understand their cultural preferences, its perceived impact on their performance, confidence, teamwork, and collaboration when it comes to having DevOps in the future. This formative study involves both qualitative and quantitative data collected from at least 50 Filipino novice programmers. 
- From this formative study, we aim to derive design guidelines that we will use to develop a prototype. From our recent results, the insights and features are introduced in Grit, as we have submitted in our Asian CHI 2020 Sympossium paper. 
- The next phases will involve, developing and iterating Grit through multiple tests and verification stages and the understanding of various human factors and affordances that affect Filipino novice programmers.
